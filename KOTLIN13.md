## Two branches

To support smooth transition to Kotlin 1.3 MockK is released in two flavours: `1.8.x` and `1.8.x.kotlin13`. 
First one is keeping old Kotlin dependency and will be deprecated. 
Second will be promoted as soon as Kotlin 1.3 is released and things stabilize.
Changes are applied to both branches and thus functionality is kept in sync.
